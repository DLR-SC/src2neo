# Src2Neo

This tool converts a [srcML](https://github.com/srcML/srcML) xml-file to a object-oriented data structure (OOS) and writes this structure into a Neo4j database.

> Note: This tool is work-in-progress ðŸš§ It is very likely that the resulting database might miss nodes and relationships.

> Note: While this tool already detects the file language (C#, Java, C++), only C# files is currently supported.
